The Apache Incubator offers valuable services to projects, referred to as "podlings," seeking entry into the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). This conference track aims to provide insights and guidance on the incubator journey, enabling attendees to gain a deeper understanding of Apache's governance and operational practices. 

Participants will learn about the process of entering the incubator and progressing towards becoming a Top-Level Project (TLP). Additionally, this track will explore strategies for building an active and diverse open-source community, while ensuring compliance with Apache's regulations.
